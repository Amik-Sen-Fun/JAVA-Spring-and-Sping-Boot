  - `src` folder that contains the production code inside `main` and inside it the `java` folder contains it
  - `test` folder that contains the test source code

# Structure of a `pom.xml` file:
- First we have the `groupID`, `artifactID` and `version` which is standard info that we look. in maven repository once we upload our project there.
